Ready/Valid Protocol

* The ready/valid hardware data transfer protocol is simple and ingenious, providing flow control with only two control signals. 

* It is a stateless protocol.

* Both parties must operate synchronously and read the control signals on the same clock edge.

* It is an ubiquitos(Widely used) protocol commonly used between a transmitter and a receiver.
* This protocol is used when there are two components communicating, say Transmitter and Receiver in a unidirectional manner (Data transfer can happen only from Tx to Rx).
* The Transmitter issues a Valid s/g to the receiver when it is ready to transmit.
* The Receiver issues a Ready s/g to the transmitter when it is ready to receive.
* The data from the transmitter is transmitted only when both the Tx's and the Rx's Valid and Ready bit respectively are 1 and 1.

According to the AMBA Specification, section A.3.2.1, there are two rules governing ready/valid behavior:

* A transmitter is not permitted to wait until READY is asserted before asserting VALID.
* Once VALID is asserted it must remain asserted until the handshake occurs, at a rising clock edge at which VALID and READY are both asserted.


MASTER - Issues the  valid signal
SKAVE - Issues the Ready signal
