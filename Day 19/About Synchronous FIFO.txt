* In synchronous FIFO, read and write operations take place at the same rate, 
i.e., read and the write operations are synchronized using the same clock
* Operations performed are:
	-> Write operation - Push data to the FIFO till it is FULL
	-> Read operation - POP data from the FIFO till it is empty
* Pointers to control operations:
	-> Write Pointer: Points to the FIFO memory location where the data will be written.
	-> Read pointer: Points to the location from where next data is to be read.
* Flags in FIFO;
	-> FULL
	-> EMPTY
* COUNT will count the total number of words in the FIFO. 
* On the basis of value of count the flag logic will assign values to flags. 
* If the count reaches a value equal to the size of FIFO it will assign FULL flag as logic high and if the count becomes zero it will assign EMPTY flag as logic high.
