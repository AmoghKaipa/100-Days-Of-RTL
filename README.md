# 100-Days-of-RTL

I have started 100 Days of RTL after being inspired by @raulbehl. The link to his Repo is https://github.com/raulbehl/100DaysOfRTL
Xilinx Vivado tool is used for executing the codes.

Day 1 : Implementation of a 2:1 mux

Day 2 : Design and verify various flavours of a D flip-flop

Day 3 : Design and verify a rising and falling edge detector

Day 4 : Design and verify a 8-bit ALU which supports addition, subtraction, SLL, LSR, AND, OR, XOR, EQL.

Day 5 : Design and verify an 8-bit odd counter

Day 6 : Design and verify a simple shift register

Day 7 : Design and verify a 4-bit linear feedback shift register where the bit[0] of the register is driven by the XOR of the LFSR register bit[1] and bit[3]

Day 8 : Design and verify a parameterized binary to one-hot converter

Day 9 : Design and verify a parameterized binary to gray code converter

Day 10 : Design and verify a counter which supports loading a value

Day 11 : Design and verify a 4-bit parallel to serial converter with valid and empty indications

Day 12 : Design and verify a sequence detector to detect the following sequence: 1110_1101_1011

Day 13 :
