// Priority arbiter without starvation
// Arbiter grants access to the device with the highest priority for a clock cycle. 
// But, if the same device was granted access in the previous clock cycle, 
// the device with the next priority is given access in the present clock cycle
// Day 14 module is also used here to find out the grant signal based on the priority
